## Adding new volume on StackBill CMP

A storage volume is a virtual disk that provides persistent block storage space for instances in **StackBill [Cloud Management Portal](https://www.stackbill.com/)** Service. You can use **storage volumes** to **store data and applications**. You can attach one or more storage volumes to an instance either while creating the instance or later when the instance is running.
